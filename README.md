# Nano DPoW

Welcome to the Distributed Proof of Work (DPoW) service hub. The DPoW system allows any user to support the Nano community services by computing the required proof of work for transactions.

DPoW has helped reduce operating costs of community projects, such as faucets, tipping bots, and wallets. As a reward for helping, clients get occasional Nano payouts.
